I make software sometimes, like lots of other people on GitHub. I also make     |
hardware sometimes, which is something a lot of people on GitHub might not do. 
Logic chips and electromagnets don't really fit in Git so I have a tile.club 
page at [~architect](https://tilde.club/~architect) and a webserver at 
[www.netlegends.net](http://www.netlegends.net) which is probably terribly 
insecure if it is even up at all, but that's what makes it fun.
